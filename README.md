# PICKUP

Ever wanted to play pick up games in your local neighborhood? Just make a PickUp account to see who's playing around you!

## 1. Briefly describe what the project accomplished.
- We created a website which expedites forming events for local pickup sports games.
Whenever a user creates an event, other users can join the event. Also, users will get
notified whenever a relevant event is created.

## 2. Discuss the usefulness of your project, i.e. what real problem you solved.
- There is a famous web platform called Meetup, which is an organizing tool for variety
of interests including hobbies, sports, gaming, etc. However, Meetup is for regularly
scheduled events and most events are usually planned ahead. So, we wanted to build a
website for allowing people to form instant events that do not have to be preplanned
or regularly scheduled. We believe that our website has a potential to provide people
the best way to simplify the process of gathering strangers to form a pickup game
event.

## 3. Discuss the data in your database
- The data in our database is information on events that are created by the users who are
willing to form a pickup game event and information about all users. We also have the
location information that has its address and name. We also store information of
which user has participated in which event.

## 4. Briefly discuss from where you collected data and how you did it (if crawling is
automated, explain how and what tools were used)
- Each of us asked our friends to create a user account, add their favorite sports with
skill levels, and the locations close to them. After that, we asked them to create real
events and join other events.

## 5. Clearly list the functionality of your application (feature specs)
### Basic Functions:
- Start user’s own pickup games at the local places. Simply make an event and
choose a location and a time so that people will be able to be notified about the
event.
- Search pickup games that a user is interested in.
- Users can remove/update the events that he/she have created.
- Users can register and sign in to their private accounts.
- User can modify their profile to insert favorite sports with skill levels and
locations nearby.
- See the names of the user who has joined the event.
### Advanced Functions:
- People are notified whenever an event is created and they play that sport, and
play at the location of the event. Also if they are within the age range, and skill
level range specified in the event. People don't get notified for events that they
themselves created, and once they join the event they are no longer notified.
- For each event created, it makes a recommendation for an ideal team
formation based on the participating users’ information.
