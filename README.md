# PICKUP

Ever wanted to play pick up games in your local neighborhood? Just make a PickUp account to see who's playing around you!

## 1. Briefly describe what the project accomplished.
- We created a website which expedites forming events for local pickup sports games.
Whenever a user creates an event, other users can join the event. Also, users will get
notified whenever a relevant event is created.

## 2. Discuss the usefulness of your project, i.e. what real problem you solved.
- There is a famous web platform called Meetup, which is an organizing tool for variety
of interests including hobbies, sports, gaming, etc. However, Meetup is for regularly
scheduled events and most events are usually planned ahead. So, we wanted to build a
website for allowing people to form instant events that do not have to be preplanned
or regularly scheduled. We believe that our website has a potential to provide people
the best way to simplify the process of gathering strangers to form a pickup game
event.

## 3. Discuss the data in your database
- The data in our database is information on events that are created by the users who are
willing to form a pickup game event and information about all users. We also have the
location information that has its address and name. We also store information of
which user has participated in which event.
